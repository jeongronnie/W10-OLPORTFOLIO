<h1 style="color:white"> Main Singer </h1>
<p style="color:white">
Singers read, memorize, and perform music to live audiences or in the studio. They may receive formal education and training, or rely purely on raw talent and hard work. Singers also collaborate with other artists and increase their employment prospects by learning to play instruments, act, and dance.
<h1 style="color:white"> Main Dancer </h1>
<p style="color:white"> As a dancer, you'll use movement, gesture and body language to portray a character, story, situation or abstract concept to an audience, usually to the accompaniment of music. This typically involves interpreting the work of a choreographer, although it may sometimes require improvisation.
