<h1><center><q> TREE </h1>
<h3><center> Joyce Kilmer </h3>
<p><center> I
<br> think I
<br> shall never see
<br> A poem as lovely as a tree
<br> A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
<br> Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast
<br> A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray
<br> A tree that 
<br> may in Summer wear
<br> A nest of robins in her hair
<br> Upon whose bosom snow has lain Who intimately lives with rain
<br> Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree </p>
<p><hr><blockquote> Christian Aaron P. Hernandez
