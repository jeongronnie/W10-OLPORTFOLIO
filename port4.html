<h1><center><b> Chicken Potato Adobo </h1>
<h2><center><i> Adobo is a philippine dish of fish or meat usually marinated in a sauce containing vinegar and garlic,
<br> browned in fat, and simmered in the marinade 
<br> Philippine adobo has a characteristically salty and sour (and often sweet) taste 
<br> in contrast to Spanish and Mexican adobos which are spicier or infused with oregano
<br><q> This is my take on the popular adobo recipe</h2>
<h3> how does this recipe differs from other common adobo recipe 
<p> this recipe uses the component of potatos
<br> to enhance the the flavor of the chicken 
<br> and stabilize the strong salty taste of soy sauce </p></h3>
