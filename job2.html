<p style="color:white">
Actors express ideas and portray characters in theater, film, television, and other performing arts media. They interpret a writer's script to entertain or inform an audience. Actors have a varied daily routine that can include auditions, rehearsals, acting classes, fitness and voice training, networking, script analysis, and character development. Performance may also be a part of their daily schedule in theater, TV, film or voiceover work.
