  <h1 style="color:white"> Creativity </h1>
<p style="color:white"> Creativity allows myself to view and solve problems more openly and with innovation. Creativity opens my own mind. I personally believe that society that has lost touch with its creative side is an imprisoned society, in that generations of people may be closed minded. It broadens our perspectives and can help us overcome prejudices.
